**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1a2b3c4/best_pm_software_10_person_startup

**Quote:**
> "We tried 5 PM tools as a 10-person startup. Asana was overkill with too many features we didn't need. Trello was too simple - no Gantt charts or time tracking. Ended up with ClickUp - perfect middle ground with free tier that actually works."
